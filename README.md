# Summer Countdown


## A simple HTML page with a JavaScript countdown to student dismissal and CSS styling.

- I wanted to create this page as a fun way to practice HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The end of the school year is always a busy and exciting time with multiple overlapping dealines. I wanted a countdown to student dismissal to display on the projector to encourage students to look forward to summer break.
- This project helped me understand the CSS concepts necessary to center divs and text. I also practiced using a color pallet to style my page.






To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:


  
   ![screenshot of page](assets/images/screenshot.png)
   


## Credits


I followed directions found at https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-create-a-countdown-timer-using-javascript to incorporate the JavaScript countdown. The explanations were very helpful in uderstanding why the code works.
