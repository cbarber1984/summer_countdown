# Summer Countdown


## An HTML page with a JavaScript countdown to student dismissal and CSS styling.

https://cbarber1984.github.io/summer_countdown/

- I wanted to create this page as a fun way to practice HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The end of the school year is always a busy and exciting time with multiple overlapping dealines. I wanted a countdown to student dismissal to display on the projector to encourage students to look forward to summer break.
- This project helped me understand the CSS concepts necessary to center divs and text. I also practiced using a color pallette to style my page.

## Next Steps
- I recognize that this could be a helpful resource for fellow faculty members to track school-wide dates such as testing, vacations, and grade deadlines.
- Move JavaScript from inline to an external file.
- I would like to explore the use of modules to make it easy to add new dates submitted by faculty.

## Credits


I followed directions found at https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-create-a-countdown-timer-using-javascript to incorporate the JavaScript countdown. The explanations were very helpful in uderstanding why the code works.
